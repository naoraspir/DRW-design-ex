# Key Insights from Prior DRW AI Candidates

## Critical Success Factors

### The CTO's Expectations (3-4 hour scope)
- **High-level design** - Not implementation details
- **System integration focus** - How components work together
- **THE Solution** - Present the definitive approach, not options
- **Well-structured, clear, reasonable** - Must pass these three tests

### Key Evaluation Criteria
**Is the plan well structured?**
- Clear logical flow from problem to solution
- Proper abstraction levels
- Easy to follow narrative

**Is the plan clear?** 
- No ambiguity in design decisions
- Clear rationale for technology choices
- Obvious integration points

**Is the plan reasonable?**
- Technically feasible with stated constraints
- Realistic resource and timeline estimates
- Practical implementation approach

**Is the timeline reasonable?**
- Accounts for real-world dependencies
- Includes risk buffers and validation phases
- Demonstrates understanding of system complexity

**What are the tradeoffs and challenges?**
- Explicit discussion of design tradeoffs
- Honest assessment of implementation challenges
- Mitigation strategies for key risks

## Strategic Focus Areas

### RAG Design Emphasis
- **Why**: This is specifically called out as important
- **Focus**: Retrieval strategies, vector management, workflow integration
- **Depth**: Show understanding of chunking, embedding, retrieval ranking

### System Integration 
- **Critical**: How all parts work together
- **Show**: Data flow diagrams, API contracts, state management
- **Avoid**: Describing components in isolation

### THE Solution Mindset
- **Present**: The definitive architecture DRW should build
- **Justify**: Why this approach vs. alternatives
- **Confidence**: Speak with authority about the design

## Updated Approach Strategy

1. **Start with system-wide architecture** - Show the big picture first
2. **Deep dive on RAG** - This is the challenging/differentiating piece  
3. **Integration story** - How everything connects and scales
4. **Implementation reality** - Realistic timeline with real challenges
5. **THE definitive recommendation** - No hedging or alternatives

## Proposal Structure (3-4 hours)
- **Executive Summary** (30 min) - The solution in one page
- **System Architecture** (90 min) - THE integrated design
- **RAG Deep Dive** (60 min) - The challenging centerpiece
- **Implementation Plan** (45 min) - Realistic timeline & tradeoffs
- **Final Polish** (15 min) - Review for clarity and structure
