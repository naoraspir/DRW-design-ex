# Fine-tuning Infrastructure

## Research Notes

### Key Requirements

- Support for various fine-tuning approaches (LoRA, QLoRA, full fine-tuning)
- GPU cluster management and scheduling
- Data management and preprocessing pipelines
- Experiment tracking and versioning
- Integration with deployment pipeline

### Technology Research Areas

- Compute platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure GPU instances, on-premise clusters)
- Fine-tuning frameworks (Transformers, Axolotl, DeepSpeed, etc.)
- Workflow orchestration (Kubeflow, MLflow, Weights & Biases)
- Data management (versioning, privacy, compliance)
- Cost optimization strategies

### Questions to Address

- What types of fine-tuning should be supported?
- How to balance cost vs. performance?
- Data privacy and security requirements?
- Integration with existing ML ops workflows?
