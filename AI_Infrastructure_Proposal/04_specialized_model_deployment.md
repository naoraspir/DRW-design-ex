# Specialized Model Deployment

## Research Notes

### Key Requirements

- Support for domain-specific models (finance, healthcare, coding, etc.)
- Model versioning and A/B testing capabilities
- Performance monitoring and comparison
- Integration with specialized hardware requirements
- Compliance and governance frameworks

### Technology Research Areas

- Model registries and versioning systems
- A/B testing frameworks for ML models
- Performance monitoring and observability
- Specialized hardware support (GPUs, TPUs, custom chips)
- Model governance and compliance tools

### Questions to Address

- How to handle models with different computational requirements?
- What metrics are important for specialized model performance?
- How to manage model lifecycles and deprecation?
- Integration with existing compliance frameworks?
