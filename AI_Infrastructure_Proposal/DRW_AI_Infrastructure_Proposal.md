## Executive Summary

**The Challenge**: DRW needs rapid access to cutting-edge AI capabilities while enabling non-technical users to create sophisticated AI workflows. Current solutions require either deep technical expertise or sacrifice advanced capabilities for simplicity.

**The Solution**: A unified, GCP-native AI platform that transforms DRW from "using AI tools" to "having an AI platform" - where every capability enhances the others through shared infrastructure and knowledge.

**Core Architecture**: A 4-layer unified platform consisting of User Layer (chat interface + visual workflow builder + admin console), API Gateway (single entry point routing), AI Services (model runtime + RAG engine + workflow engine as microservices), and Infrastructure (Kubernetes + managed GCP AI services + monitoring).

**Key Benefits**:

- 24-hour model deployment with automated pipeline from detection to chat and workflow availability
- RAG provides immediate domain knowledge while fine-tuning runs in background for improved accuracy
- Specialized models for financial, quantitative, and research workflows with intelligent routing
- Visual workflow builder creates autonomous agents with memory, planning, and tool integration

**The Bottom Line**: This platform delivers compound value where each capability improves the others - new models instantly benefit from existing knowledge, fine-tuned models improve RAG accuracy, and agentic workflows become more capable as knowledge grows. DRW gains a competitive advantage through an AI platform that evolves with their needs and scales with their ambitions.

## System Architecture

[DIAGRAM 1: System Architecture Overview]

### Platform Philosophy

This solution leverages **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** to maximize AI/ML capabilities through managed services including Vertex AI, AutoML, Vector Search, and BigQuery ML. The architecture treats all AI capabilities as interconnected services within a single, coherent system that becomes more valuable as each component enhances the others.

### 4-Layer Architecture

**User Experience Layer**

- Chat Interface: Direct model interaction with conversation history and context
- Workflow Builder: Drag-and-drop visual interface for creating agentic workflows  
- Admin Console: Model management, monitoring, and system configuration

**API Gateway & Orchestration**

- Unified API Gateway: Single entry point with 24-hour model integration pipeline
- Authentication, rate limiting, load balancing, and intelligent request routing
- Handles both real-time chat interactions and automated workflow execution

**Core AI Services Layer**

- **Model Runtime**: LLM serving with auto-scaling, A/B testing, and health monitoring. Handles both general-purpose and specialized models (financial, quantitative, research) with dynamic resource allocation
- **RAG Engine**: Vector storage, retrieval, embeddings, and knowledge-powered generation
- **Workflow Engine**: Agentic chains with state management, memory persistence, and error handling

**Infrastructure Layer**

- Compute Cluster: Kubernetes clusters with GPU/CPU pools and auto-scaling
- Data Platform: Data lake, feature store, and model registry with version control
- Observability: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting across all services

### Service Integration & Data Flow

**Cross-Service Communication**: Event-driven architecture using GCP Pub/Sub for message queues and event streams. Services maintain loose coupling while sharing state through Redis-based caching for session and workflow persistence.

**Model Deployment Pipeline**: Automated detection of new models → containerized deployment → quality validation → production rollout with blue-green deployment patterns. New models become immediately available through both chat interface and workflow API within 24 hours.

**Knowledge Integration**: RAG Engine continuously ingests data from DRW sources, processes through chunking and embedding pipelines, and provides context-aware responses. Fine-tuning processes run in parallel, using RAG-retrieved context to improve specialized model accuracy over time.

**Specialized Model Management**: Model Registry catalogs all models with capability tags and domain classifications. API Gateway intelligently routes requests to optimal specialized models based on request type and business context, while dynamic resource allocation ensures appropriate GPU/CPU provisioning.

## RAG Architecture Deep Dive

[DIAGRAM 2: RAG Architecture & Integration]

### RAG as the Knowledge Backbone

The RAG Engine serves as the central knowledge backbone that transforms static documents into queryable intelligence, enabling knowledge-augmented AI across all system capabilities. Rather than treating retrieval as a separate component, RAG is architected as the foundational layer that makes every LLM interaction contextually aware and domain-specific.

### Core RAG Architecture

**Vector Storage & Retrieval**: Built on GCP Vector Search for managed, scalable vector operations with standardized embedding pipelines that work with any model. Implements hybrid search combining semantic similarity with keyword matching and business rules for comprehensive retrieval with metadata preservation for citation and filtering.

**Document Processing Pipeline**: Intelligent chunking preserves document context while creating searchable segments, with multi-format support handling various document types through unified processing. The pipeline continuously ingests from DRW data sources through automated workflows.

**Knowledge Integration**: Context-aware generation uses retrieved knowledge with reranking algorithms to ensure relevance. The system maintains continuous improvement through feedback loops, learning from user interactions and outcomes to enhance retrieval accuracy over time.

### Integration with Platform Capabilities

**24-Hour Model Deployment**: New LLMs immediately access the existing knowledge base through standardized retrieval APIs. Consistent prompt templates work across different model architectures, ensuring knowledge remains available regardless of underlying model changes. This integration enables new models to provide domain-specific value from day one.

**Fine-Tuning Integration**: RAG provides training context for domain-specific model fine-tuning, with retrieved documents serving as few-shot examples for improved model performance. The knowledge base grows with fine-tuned model outputs, creating a compound learning effect where better models improve knowledge quality.

**Specialized Model Support**: Different embedding models can be deployed for specific document types, with specialized retrieval strategies for different business domains. Domain-specific ranking and filtering capabilities ensure that financial models access financial knowledge, quantitative models access analytical data, and research models access research documents.

**Ergonomic Workflow Abstractions**: Pre-built RAG components hide retrieval complexity from users through template-based knowledge queries and visual workflow integration. Business users can create workflows using high-level operations like "Find similar documents", "Summarize context", or "Extract key insights" without understanding the underlying vector search mechanics.

### Platform Enablement Through RAG

RAG transforms the platform from basic "AI model access" to "intelligent knowledge-powered workflows" by providing model-agnostic interfaces that work with any LLM, ensuring knowledge continuity across model updates and specialized deployments. The scalable foundation built on GCP managed services grows with organizational knowledge while maintaining user accessibility through abstracted operations that hide complexity behind business-friendly interfaces.
