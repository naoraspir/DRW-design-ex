# Clarifying Questions for DRW AI Infrastructure Proposal

Hi Bridget,

Thank you for the interesting take-home assignment! I have a few clarifying questions to ensure my proposal addresses DRW's specific needs:

**Model Scope & Deployment:**

1. By "publications," do you mean external models (GPT, Claude, Llama) or internal DRW models, or both?
2. What constitutes "deployment within 24 hours":
   - Just making the model API available?
   - Full production readiness with monitoring?
   - Basic safety/performance validation?

**Specialized Models:**

3. When referring to "specialized models," do you mean domain-specific LLMs (financial analysis) or other ML model types (classification, forecasting)?

**User Personas & Ergonomic Abstractions:**

4. Who are the primary users you envision:
   - Data scientists and ML engineers?
   - Business analysts and domain experts?
   - Software developers building applications?
5. Could you provide an example of the agentic workflows DRW envisions (e.g., trading decision support, research pipelines)?

**Architecture & Infrastructure:**

6. What's your preference for architecture philosophy:
   - Cloud-native (AWS/GCP/Azure focused)?
   - Hybrid approach (cloud + on-premise)?
   - Technology-agnostic platform?
7. Any specific compliance requirements (financial regulations, data privacy) to consider?

**Business Context:**

8. How does this fit into DRW's broader strategy:
   - Internal productivity tool?
   - Competitive advantage for trading/analysis?
   - Potential product offering?

These details will help me create a more targeted and practical proposal.

Best regards,
Naor
