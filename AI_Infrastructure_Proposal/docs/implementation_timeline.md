# Implementation Timeline

## 3-Phase Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Months 1-3)

**Core Capabilities:**
- Basic 24-hour model deployment pipeline
- Simple RAG workflow with GCP Vector Search
- Initial chat interface for model access
- Basic workflow builder (no agentic features yet)

**Key Deliverables:**
- API Gateway + Model Runtime microservices
- RAG Engine with document ingestion
- Admin console for model management
- Chat interface for user access

**Risk Buffer:** +2 weeks for GCP integration complexities

### Phase 2: Production Ready (Months 4-8)

**Enhanced Capabilities:**
- Full fine-tuning infrastructure
- Production-grade RAG workflows
- Specialized model deployment
- Basic agentic workflows (with LangGraph)

**Key Deliverables:**
- Fine-tuning pipeline with Vertex AI
- Advanced RAG with hybrid search
- Specialized model registry
- Agent runtime with memory/planning

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 core services must be stable
**Risk Buffer:** +3 weeks for agentic workflow complexity

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 9-12)

**Complete Platform:**
- Advanced agentic workflows with tool integration
- Multi-model orchestration
- Performance optimization (vLLM, TensorRT)
- Enterprise features (monitoring, security)

**Key Deliverables:**
- Full agent capabilities with external tools
- Production inference optimization
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Security and compliance framework

**Dependencies:** Phase 2 agent foundation required
**Risk Buffer:** +4 weeks for enterprise requirements

## Validation Checkpoints

**Month 3:** Basic platform demo - all 4 capabilities working
**Month 6:** Production pilot with limited users
**Month 9:** Full capability validation
**Month 12:** Enterprise deployment ready

## Critical Dependencies

- GCP services availability and quotas
- Model access agreements (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Internal data access for RAG workflows
- Security/compliance approvals for production

## Success Metrics

- **24-hour deployment**: New model available within SLA
- **RAG accuracy**: >85% relevant retrieval on domain queries
- **User adoption**: 70% of target users active monthly
- **System reliability**: 99.5% uptime for core services
