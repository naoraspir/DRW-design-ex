Hi Naor,

Thanks for your interest in DRW and our AI role! For the first step, your job is to create and propose a plan for achieving the following goals. For the purpose of this exercise, you can assume no prior infrastructure or capabilities exist.

Evaluate and deploy new LLM models within 24 hours of their publication, making them accessible for both chat and automated workflow integration

Build and deploy infrastructure that allows users to fine tune and build RAG workflows

Build and deploy infrastructure that allows for the deployment of specialized models

Using available tools and methods, create ergonomic abstractions that allow users without deep understanding of LLMs to create agentic workflows

Please include a well structured proposal with technology requirements and suggestions. Your proposal should include expected timelines, along with expected challenges and risks.
