# Ergonomic Abstractions for Agentic Workflows

## Research Notes

### Key Requirements

- No-code/low-code interface for non-technical users
- Template system for common workflow patterns
- Visual workflow builder with drag-and-drop capabilities
- Integration with existing business tools and APIs
- Robust error handling and debugging tools

### Technology Research Areas

- Workflow orchestration platforms (Zapier, n8n, Temporal, etc.)
- Visual programming environments
- Agent framework abstractions (LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGPT patterns)
- API integration and connector ecosystems
- User interface design patterns for AI workflows

### Questions to Address

- What level of complexity should be hidden vs. exposed?
- How to balance flexibility with ease of use?
- What are the most common agentic workflow patterns?
- How to handle failures and provide meaningful feedback?
