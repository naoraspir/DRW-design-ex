# Rapid Model Deployment (24-Hour Goal)

## Research Notes

### Key Requirements
- Monitor model releases from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Google, etc.)
- Automated pipeline from detection to deployment
- Support for both proprietary APIs and open-source models
- Integration with chat interfaces and workflow automation

### Technology Research Areas
- Model serving frameworks (TGI, vLLM, Triton, etc.)
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- API gateways and load balancing
- Model monitoring and observability
- Automated testing and validation

### Questions to Address
- What constitutes "deployment" - API availability, performance benchmarking, safety validation?
- How to handle different model formats and requirements?
- What level of testing/validation can be done in 24 hours?
