# RAG Workflow Infrastructure

## Research Notes

### Key Requirements

- Vector database management and scaling
- Document processing and embedding pipelines
- Retrieval optimization and ranking
- Integration with various data sources
- User-friendly workflow creation tools

### Technology Research Areas

- Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Qdrant, etc.)
- Embedding models and strategies
- Document processing (OCR, parsing, chunking)
- Retrieval methods (semantic, hybrid, re-ranking)
- Workflow orchestration tools

### Questions to Address

- How to handle different document types and formats?
- What retrieval strategies work best for different use cases?
- How to make RAG accessible to non-technical users?
- Performance and cost optimization strategies?
