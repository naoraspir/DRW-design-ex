# Design Tradeoffs and Challenges

## Key Design Decisions

### Microservices vs Monolith

**Decision: Microservices Architecture**

**Tradeoffs:**
- **Pro**: Independent scaling of GPU-heavy model serving vs lightweight RAG retrieval
- **Pro**: Fault isolation - RAG failure doesn't break model serving
- **Con**: Increased complexity in service coordination and debugging
- **Why Chosen**: AI workloads have vastly different resource needs and scaling patterns

### Cloud vs On-Premise

**Decision: GCP-Native Cloud**

**Tradeoffs:**
- **Pro**: Managed AI services (Vertex AI, Vector Search) reduce operational overhead
- **Pro**: Elastic GPU scaling for variable model serving demands
- **Con**: Vendor lock-in and ongoing cloud costs
- **Why Chosen**: 24-hour model deployment requires rapid provisioning impossible on-prem

### Build vs Buy for ML Components

**Decision: Hybrid Approach**

**Build**: Custom orchestration, workflow engine, API gateway
**Buy**: Vector databases, model serving infrastructure, monitoring
**Tradeoffs:**
- **Pro**: Focus engineering effort on differentiating capabilities
- **Con**: Integration complexity between custom and third-party components
- **Why Chosen**: Maximize speed to market while maintaining control over core logic

## Technical Challenges

### Model Versioning at Scale

**Challenge**: Managing hundreds of model variants with different capabilities
**Solution**: Semantic versioning with capability tagging in model registry
**Risk**: Version conflicts between fine-tuned and specialized models
**Mitigation**: Automated compatibility testing in deployment pipeline

### GPU Resource Management

**Challenge**: Balancing cost vs performance across variable workloads
**Solution**: Dynamic allocation with priority-based scheduling
**Risk**: Resource contention during peak usage
**Mitigation**: Predictive scaling based on usage patterns + reserved capacity

### RAG Accuracy vs Latency

**Challenge**: Comprehensive retrieval increases latency
**Solution**: Parallel retrieval with early termination for time-sensitive queries
**Risk**: Accuracy degradation under latency constraints
**Mitigation**: Configurable accuracy/speed profiles per use case

## Implementation Risks

**High Risk**: Agentic workflow complexity - memory management and state persistence
**Medium Risk**: Multi-model orchestration - ensuring consistent behavior
**Low Risk**: Basic model deployment - well-established patterns

## Success Dependencies

- **Technical**: GCP quota increases for GPU resources
- **Business**: Clear SLAs for each capability (speed vs accuracy)
- **Organizational**: Cross-team collaboration for data access and integration
