# RAG Architecture Deep Dive

## RAG as the Knowledge Backbone

The RAG Engine is the central component that enables knowledge-augmented AI across all system capabilities. It transforms static documents into queryable knowledge that enhances every LLM interaction.

## Core RAG Architecture

### Vector Storage & Retrieval

- **Vector Database**: GCP Vector Search for managed, scalable vector operations
- **Embedding Strategy**: Standardized embedding pipeline that works with any model
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines semantic similarity with keyword matching for comprehensive retrieval

### Document Processing Pipeline

```text
Documents → Chunking → Embedding → Vector Storage → Retrieval → Reranking → Context Generation
```

- **Intelligent Chunking**: Preserves document context while creating searchable segments
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handles various document types through unified processing
- **Metadata Preservation**: Maintains source information for citation and filtering

## Integration with System Capabilities

### 1. 24-Hour Model Deployment
- New LLMs immediately access existing knowledge base through standardized retrieval API
- Consistent prompt templates work across different model architectures
- Knowledge remains available regardless of underlying model changes

### 2. Fine-Tuning Integration
- RAG provides training context for domain-specific model fine-tuning
- Retrieved documents can be used as few-shot examples for improved model performance
- Knowledge base grows with fine-tuned model outputs

### 3. Specialized Model Support
- Different embedding models can be deployed for specific document types
- Specialized retrieval strategies for different business domains
- Domain-specific ranking and filtering capabilities

### 4. Ergonomic Workflow Abstractions
- Pre-built RAG components hide retrieval complexity from users
- Template-based knowledge queries ("Find similar documents", "Summarize context")
- Visual workflow builder integrates RAG seamlessly into business processes

## Why RAG Enables the Unified Platform

**Model Agnostic**: RAG works with any LLM through standardized interfaces, supporting rapid model deployment

**Knowledge Continuity**: Business knowledge persists across model updates and specialized deployments  

**User Accessibility**: Complex retrieval logic is abstracted into simple, business-friendly operations

**Scalable Foundation**: Built on GCP managed services, scales with organizational knowledge growth

RAG transforms the platform from just "AI model access" to "intelligent knowledge-powered workflows" that directly address DRW's business needs.
